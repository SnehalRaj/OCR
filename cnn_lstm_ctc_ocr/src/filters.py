# filters.py - Options/examples for building Dataset input filters based on
# image or label string size


# READ THIS BEFORE WRITING YOUR OWN FILTER FUNCTION
#
# To be used as filter_fn's passed into call to pipeline.get_data
# Filters for must be written in the following structure:
# * filter_fn(image, width, label, length, text)
# VAR            : tf.dtype, shape
# --------------------------------------------
# image          : tf.float32, [32, ?, 1] HWC
# width          : tf.int32, []
# label          : tf.int32, [?]
# length         : tf.int32, []
# text           : tf.string, []
#
#
# Note: For more detailed information, refer to `_preprocess_fn` in
# mjsynth.py. Filtering is performed after these transformations have
# been applied. Therefore, filter_fn args will correspond to the
# return values of `preprocess_fn`.
